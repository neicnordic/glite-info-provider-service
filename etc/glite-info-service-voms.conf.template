# This is the configuration file for the GlueService information provider
# for a VOMS server

# Many of the entries are commands which will be executed
# using backquotes in perl. They should write to stdout - the return
# code is not relevant except for init and status.

# The init command allows any setup command to be executed
# A non-zero return code will abort the provider
# Environment variables can be set by writing to stdout (x=y)

# The init script takes the VO name as an argument; this is generally
# set by the glite-info-service-voms-wrapper script

# http://glueschema.forge.cnaf.infn.it/V12/ServiceType

# in the format 3[.2[.1]]. Set to the server RPM version.

# in the init script)

# A command to check the status of the service. The status message should be
# returned to stdout - it can be multi-line, the output will be massaged
# and truncated if necessary. 
# The return code should indicate the status:
# 0 = OK, 1 = Critical, 2 = Warning, 3 = Unknown, other = Other

# This should be a unix timestamp, the info provider converts it to ISO8601

# Owner: this should return a list of owner VO names, one per line
# Null entries will be omitted

# have access to the service - at the simplest this is the same as the
# Owner but with the VO names prefixed by "VO:"
